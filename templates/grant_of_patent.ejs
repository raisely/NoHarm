## 4. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
<%= type_of_license.patent.join(', ') %> patent license to
<%= join(permissions.patent) %> the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or
a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work must terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.
